## Project Overview
This project focuses on using Git as a version control system to manage and track changes in software development. The repository contains exercises demonstrating Git's core functionalities, including repository initialization, branching, merging, handling conflicts, and reverting changes.

### Key Concepts:
- **Repository Initialization**: Setting up a Git repository for the project.
- **Branching**: Creating separate branches for different features and simulating a merge conflict.
- **Stashing**: Saving uncommitted changes temporarily to work on other tasks.
- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Resolving conflicts that arise during merging branches.
- **Commit History**: Viewing and managing commit logs to track the project's development history.
