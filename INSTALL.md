# Installation Instructions

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git**: A version control system to clone the repository.
  - [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Steps to Install

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CSC510-Team-Wise-Vilkomir-Sykes/git-homework.git
```


### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd git-homework
```

### 3. Open the HTML File

Since the project includes a simple HTML webpage (`team.html`), you can open it in a browser. Use one of the following methods:

- **Method 1**: If you have an IDE (like VSCode), right-click the `team.html` file and select `Open with Live Server` (if you have the Live Server extension installed).
  
- **Method 2**: Open the file manually in a browser:
  - For Mac/Linux:
    ```bash
    open team.html
    ```
  - For Windows:
    ```bash
    start team.html
    ```

Alternatively, you can manually open the file from your file explorer in any web browser.
